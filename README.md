# üõ°Ô∏è Battleship on Oasis Sapphire: Private On-Chain Gameplay

This is a fully on-chain implementation of the classic Battleship game, built to demonstrate the power of **[Oasis Sapphire](https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire)**‚Äîthe first confidential EVM-compatible blockchain with support for **private smart contract state** and **encrypted transactions**.

Unlike traditional EVM networks, where all on-chain data is publicly visible, this project leverages Sapphire‚Äôs confidential compute features to enforce **cheat-proof gameplay** by ensuring that:

- üîê **Player boards are kept private**: Each player‚Äôs ship placements remain encrypted and inaccessible to opponents throughout the match.
- üß† **Moves and hits are securely processed**: Attacks are privately evaluated by the smart contract, which only reveals the outcome (hit/miss) to the relevant parties.
- üõ†Ô∏è **End-to-end verifiability**: While players enjoy full privacy, game logic is still transparently enforced by a smart contract‚Äîensuring fairness without sacrificing decentralization.

### üéÆ Game Features

- 6x6 grid-based Battleship game
- Create/join game lobbies on-chain
- Place ships privately
- Turn-based attacks processed via encrypted transactions
- Private state updates based on Sapphire‚Äôs confidential compute

### üîí Why Oasis Sapphire?

Standard EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum or Polygon cannot hide player boards because all contract state and transaction calldata are publicly visible. As a result, any on-chain Battleship implementation without special cryptography (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) is fundamentally vulnerable to cheating.

Oasis Sapphire solves this by offering:

- Confidential smart contract storage
- Encrypted transaction input/output
- Compatibility with existing Ethereum tooling (e.g., Solidity, Hardhat, MetaMask)

This project showcases how **game logic requiring secrecy** can be elegantly implemented **without relying on complex off-chain infrastructure or cryptographic tricks**.

## Install

This monorepo is set up for `pnpm`. Install dependencies by running:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Backend

Move to the `backend` folder and build smart contracts:

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Localnet deployment and Testing

Spin up the [Sapphire Localnet] image:

```shell
docker run -it -p8544-8548:8544-8548 ghcr.io/oasisprotocol/sapphire-localnet
```

Once Localnet is ready, deploy the contract using the first test account by
invoking:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
npx hardhat deploy localhost --network sapphire-localnet
```

Similarly, you can run tests on Localnet:

```shell
npx hardhat test --network sapphire-localnet
```

### Production deployment

Prepare your hex-encoded private key for paying the deployment gas fee and store
it as an environment variable:

```shell
export PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

Alternative CMD command for Windows:

```powershell
set PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

To deploy the contract on Testnet or Mainnet for your dApp that will be
accessible on `yourdomain.com`:

```shell
npx hardhat deploy yourdomain.com --network sapphire-testnet
npx hardhat deploy yourdomain.com --network sapphire
```

## Frontend

Once the contract is deployed, the Battleship address will be reported. Store it
inside the `frontend` folder's `.env.development` (for Localnet) or
`.env.production` (for Testnet or Mainnet - uncomment the appropriate network),
for example:

```
VITE_BATTLESHIP_ADDR=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```

### Run locally

Run the hot-reload version of the frontend configured in `.env.development` by
running:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5173 with your browser to view your dApp. Some
browsers (e.g. Brave) may require https connection and a CA-signed certificate
to access the wallet. In this case, read the section below on how to properly
deploy your dApp.

Note: If you use the same MetaMask accounts in your browser and restart the
sapphire-localnet docker image, don't forget to _clear your MetaMask activity_
each time to fetch correct account nonce.

### Production deployment

Build assets for deployment by running:

```sh
pnpm build
```

`dist` folder will contain the generated HTML files that can be hosted.
